This is actually part of the source code for Where's My Mickey / Where's My XiYangYang (it includes stuff for xyy, but most of it looks like wmm). I have no idea how disney didn't take down the original repository, because I'm pretty sure it's been public for 10 years.

According to @AwesomeDragon970#8068 (discord tag), this part of the code is the C++ equivalent of wmw_spl_act_wheresmywater_750x500.swf in the flash version.
> Almost all of the folders in wmw_spl_act_wheresmywater_750x500.swf have a direct or close C++ equivalent. The only major one missing is WaterConcept, which in the Flash version contains the code for managing fluids, dirt/rock and objects.
So someone who is skilled in C++ might be able to port the Flash code in WaterConcept into C++ code.

If disney takes this down, at least I have a copy of it all on my computer. I am taking a very risky move by creating a new public fork of this repo.
